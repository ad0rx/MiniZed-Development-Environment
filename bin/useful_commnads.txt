# Simple Git Workflow
1. pull from master
> git clone <git repo URL>

2. create a local branch
> git checkout -b myfeature

3. Do your edits
   Edits made to files under work/ will be lost,
   be sure to save the files outside of work/
   
4. Commit your local changes to the local repo
> git commit <file>

5. Switch back to master branch and update
> git checkout master
> git pull origin master

6. Merge the local branch back into master
> git merge myfeature

7. Run scripts to make sure nothing broke
> top.sh

8. Commit to the main repo on github
> git push origin master

9. Delete local branch
> git branch -d myfeature
